Building Blocks of Angular
    Component
        - View
        - Encapsulates the presentation + UI Behavior + State
        - Can be composed of other components
        - decorated with @Component() decorator

    Directive
        - low level DOM manipulation logic
            attribute directive
                that manipulates the attributes of existing dom nodes
                DOESNOT change the structure of the DOM tree (by adding / removing dom nodes)
                used with [] notation

            stuctural directive
                change the structure of the DOM tree (by adding / removing dom nodes)
                used with * prefix
    Pipe
        - Encapsulates transformation logic for presentation

    Service
        - NON UI logic

    Module
        - Registry of application entities (Component, Pipe, Directive, Service)
        - Dependency Injection is taken care of by the Module
        - Acts as the starting point of our application
        - There has to be a minimum of 1 module in any angular application
        - classes decorated with decorator @NgModule

ES6 Modules
    - ES6 modules are a way to organize our code into logical units
    - Everything defined in a file is considered 'PRIVATE'
    - Public entities have to be explicity 'exported' (using the 'export' keyword)
    - Public entities from other files have to be explicity imported (using the 'import' keyword) to use them

    Array Methods
        - forEach
        - map
        - reduce
        - filter


TO create a new component
    ng generate component greeter
    OR
    ng g c greeter


to install moment
    npm install moment

    to use moment
    import * as moment from 'moment'
    moment('2021-08-18T09:20:26.721Z').fromNow()


Pure Function
    - A function that does not have side effects
    - A function whose invocation can be replaced with the result of the function without affecting the final outcome

    Memoization
        - A technique to cache the result of a function

    
Async Operations
    - Callback (singular)
    - Promises (singular)
    - Async Await (singular)
    - Observables (rxjs)
        operators
            - map
            - filter
            - reduce
            - scan
            - switchMap
            - mergeMap

    - Timer events (plural)
    - Websockets (plural)
    - Server Sent Events (plural)
    - AJAX (singlular)
