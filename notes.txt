Building Blocks of Angular
    Component
        - View
        - Encapsulates the presentation + UI Behavior + State
        - Can be composed of other components
        - decorated with @Component() decorator

    Directive
        - low level DOM manipulation logic

    Pipe
        - Encapsulates transformation logic for presentation

    Service
        - NON UI logic

    Module
        - Registry of application entities (Component, Pipe, Directive, Service)
        - Dependency Injection is taken care of by the Module
        - Acts as the starting point of our application
        - There has to be a minimum of 1 module in any angular application
        - classes decorated with decorator @NgModule

ES6 Modules
    - ES6 modules are a way to organize our code into logical units
    - Everything defined in a file is considered 'PRIVATE'
    - Public entities have to be explicity 'exported' (using the 'export' keyword)
    - Public entities from other files have to be explicity imported (using the 'import' keyword) to use them
